### Intro

```Javascript
var myArray = [1, 2, 3];
```

Think of an array almost like a list of items, you can add and remove stuff to the list,
then retrieve a value from the list whenever you need to

The position of each element in the array is called the index

the first element has index 0
the second element has index 1
the third has index 2
and so on

Its important to note arrays start at 0

you can retrieve an element from an aray by typing the arrays name, followed by the index in backets

it should look a little like this

arrayName[index]

Here is an example of an array in practicec

```Javascript
var cars = ["honda", "volvo", "toyota", "ford", "BMW"];

var myCar = cars[1];

console.log(mycar); // outputs volvo

```

Javascript has a lot of built in methods you can do to the array, but they wont be covered here
