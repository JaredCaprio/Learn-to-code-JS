here are some important things to do, if you want to maximize your learning

- Try it yourself, play with the code, see what works and what doesnt
    - Remember that coding is a craft like any other
    You cant learn carpentry by watching someone else make a chair, you need 
    to do it yourself. 

- If you dont know something, dont hesitate to google it
    - its important that you understant as much as possible
    so that you only need to learn one thing at once

- Dont skip any lessons
    - each concept is more important than you probably realize

    Its easy to say " I wont ever need this ", but saying that is a huge mistake
    so dont skip any lessons

- Dont stress about the challenges
    - the challenges at the end of each lesson are there so you can get an idea of how
    different concepts or keywords can be used

    - Even if you dont want to bother solving the challenge, you should still look at the solutions
